- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, Iâ€™m Diego
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in finding an entry level SDE role. This GitHub is a collection of projects and assignments I worked on while earning my Bachelor's in CS. (May 2024)
- ðŸ’¼ Currently I work as an IT Support Associate for Amazon. None of the content I post here is affiliated with Amazon and my opinions are my own.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in learning Java on my own but have experience with other languages like: C, C++, C#, Python, and SQL. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love science fiction! I just finished reading *Ender's Game* and *Ender's Shadow* and I'm now reading the next book *Shadow of the Hegemon*.
