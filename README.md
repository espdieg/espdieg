- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, Iâ€™m Diego
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in finding an entry level Software Development role. This GitHub is a collection of projects I worked on while earning my Bachelor's in CS. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in learning Java on my own but have experience with other languages like: C++, C#, Python, and SQL. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love science fiction! I just finished reading *Ender's Game* and *Ender's Shadow* and I'm still trying to decide if I should read *Speaker for the Dead* next or *Shadow of the Hegemon*.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: espdieg@outlook.com.
